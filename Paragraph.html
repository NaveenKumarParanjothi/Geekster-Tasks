        <p> HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language. 
            HTML is the standard markup language for creating Web pages. 
            HTML describes the structure of a Web page. 
            HTML consists of a series of elements. 
            HTML elements tell the browser how to display the content. 
            HTML elements label pieces of content such as "this is a heading", "this is a paragraph", "this is a link", etc.
        </p>
       </div>
       <div>
           <p>
               The HTML p element defines a paragraph. A paragraph always starts on a new line, and browsers automatically add some white space (a margin) before and after a paragraph.
